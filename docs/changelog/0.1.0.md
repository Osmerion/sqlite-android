### 0.1.0

_Not Released Yet_

#### Overview

This release bundles SQLite `3.46.1`.

This project is a distribution of the latest versions of SQLite for Android. It implements the [androidx.sqlite](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/sqlite)
API for broad compatibility with Android libraries. In many cases, this library can be used as a drop-in
replacement for the Android platform's built-in SQLite libraries.

This repository was forked from [requery/sqlite-android](https://github.com/requery/sqlite-android)
to streamline the build process, which allows us to support newer versions of SQLite faster, and to
provide stable artifacts reliably via Maven Central.
